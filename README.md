## 1 Benchmarking functional
Goal: Report accuracy and performance of different functionals for Density Functional Theory calculation on molecular orbital energies: HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbitals), LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals) and Bandgap.
Results: 
- Predictions from different functionals;
- Linear regression formula for corrections on calculated values (scaling factors) in order to match experimental values;
- HSE06 functional was selected due to the accurracy on both HOMO and Bandgap predictions.
