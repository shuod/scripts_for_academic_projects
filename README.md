## 1_benchmarking_DFT_functionals
Goal: Report accuracy and performance of different functionals for Density Functional Theory calculation on molecular orbital energies: HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbitals), LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals) and Bandgap.
Results: 

- (phase1) Predictions from different functionals on 29 molecules ;
- (phase1) Linear regression formula for corrections on calculated values (scaling factors) in order to match experimental values;
- (phase1) HSE06 functional was selected due to the accuracy on both HOMO and Bandgap predictions;
- (phase2) Gradient boosted random trees and other machine learning methods were tested against traditional DFT/TD-DFT methods;

## 3_top1000_molecule_screening_for_tandem_solar_cells

Goal: Explore the correlations between solar spectrum coverage and the built pattern of top-1000 molecules in CEPDB database (Harvard Clean Energy Project Database); Apply the correlation found to discover molecules for tandem solar cell.
